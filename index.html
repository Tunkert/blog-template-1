				<h2>Githubs API Project</h2>
				<p>I thought to myself, I really haven't brought an API into a project in a few weeks and felt like the time was right to do another one of those. I'd been focusing on quiz type projects while finishing up my teaching career. These full stack applications randomly generated problems, came up with correct and incorrect multiple choice answers and randomized the order of the solutions. They also graded the student based upon student choice and then after the student submitted a form at the end of the quiz, they sent the grade to a database. I didn't have to grade them so it was pretty sweet!</p>

I don't think I need all the stuff - you have a popup that gives you 30 different things you could type next but maybe that's a crutch. Maybe you should just know what to type. For instance if I'm creating a for loop in Javascript for a program with math problems I might loop through the problem paragraphs as follows:</p>

				<h2>Why Does this Website Look Like it's the 90s</h2>
				<p>I was watching a YouTube video by Luke Smith (of LukeSmith.xyz) and he was going on a rant about CSS. He made a very good point I agree with, the websites with the fanciest stuff tend to have the least useful information. I tend to have a theory on that - the websites that spend the least time on the fancy stuff have more time to spend on useful information.</p>
